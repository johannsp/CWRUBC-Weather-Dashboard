On submission of a city name, weather information is retrieved both for today
and as a five day forecast.  The city is also added below as a clickable tile
button, which allows toggling between selected cities to compare weather.  The
last retrieved forecast is saved into persistent storage, so it can be reloaded
the next time a user visits the web site.

This weather dashboard is implemented with Bulma as a web frame work.
